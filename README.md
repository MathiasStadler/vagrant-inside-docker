# About
Running vagrant inside a docker container. We use a small box based on OpenWRT 15.05 as a lightweight distro (7MB).

# Requirements
- You need vagrant kernel modules on the host.
- virtualbox version HOST = Container  => I'm used 5.1
- I'm used vagrant 1.9.6 for virtualbox 5.1 ++

# Don't DRY
